# This Expect script was generated by autoexpect on Wed Mar 29 15:06:06 2017
# Expect and autoexpect were both written by Don Libes, NIST.
#
# Note that autoexpect does not guarantee a working script.  It
# necessarily has to guess about certain things.  Two reasons a script
# might fail are:
#
# 1) timing - A surprising number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, telnet,
# etc.) and devices discard or ignore keystrokes that arrive "too
# quickly" after prompts.  If you find your new script hanging up at
# one spot, try adding a short sleep just before the previous send.
# Setting "force_conservative" to 1 (see below) makes Expect do this
# automatically - pausing briefly before sending each character.  This
# pacifies every program I know of.  The -c flag makes the script do
# this in the first place.  The -C flag allows you to define a
# character to toggle this mode off and on.

set force_conservative 0  ;# set to 1 to force conservative mode even if
			  ;# script wasn't run conservatively originally
if {$force_conservative} {
	set send_slow {1 .1}
	proc send {ignore arg} {
		sleep .1
		exp_send -s -- $arg
	}
}

#
# 2) differing output - Some programs produce different output each time
# they run.  The "date" command is an obvious example.  Another is
# ftp, if it produces throughput statistics at the end of a file
# transfer.  If this causes a problem, delete these patterns or replace
# them with wildcards.  An alternative is to use the -p flag (for
# "prompt") which makes Expect only look for the last line of output
# (i.e., the prompt).  The -P flag allows you to define a character to
# toggle this mode off and on.
#

\r
16. GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION\r
(a) This Agreement shall not be governed by the 1980 U.N. Convention on\r
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods; rather, this Agreement shall\r
be governed by the laws of the State of New York, including its Uniform\r
Commercial Code, without reference to conflicts of laws principles, subject\r
to the mandatory arbitration provisions below in Section 16(c).\r
\r
(b) Both you and Ubiquiti consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such\r
courts; provided, however, that Ubiquiti reserves the right to institute\r
proceedings against you in the courts having jurisdiction in the places\r
where you reside, do business, have assets, or in any jurisdiction where a\r
harm to Ubiquiti is occurring or has occurred. In any action or proceeding\r

expect -exact "\r
to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party will be\r
entitled to recover costs and attorney?s fees. Notwithstanding anything\r
herein (including the mandatory arbitration provision below), in the event\r
you infringe or misappropriate any of Ubiquiti?s intellectual property\r
rights, Ubiquiti is entitled to seek any permanent or temporary remedies\r
(including, without limitation, compensation for damages, ceasing of\r
infringement act, injunctive reliefs) against you in accordance with the\r
applicable laws of your resident country or the jurisdiction where such\r
infringing act has transpired.\r
\r
(c) Mandatory Arbitration. Arbitration is a form of private dispute\r
resolution in which persons having a dispute agree to waive their right to\r
file a lawsuit to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead agree to\r
present their dispute to a neutral third party (arbitrator) for binding\r
decision. You have the right to opt-out of this provision which means that\r
you retain your right to file a lawsuit; to do so, you must read carefully\r
and follow the directions under the paragraph listed How to Opt Out of\r
Mandatory Arbitration. Unless you Opt Out of the Mandatory Arbitration, you\r
will be understood to have agreed to the mandatory arbitration and to the\r
provisions provided below.\r

ARBITRATION (EXCEPT FOR MATTERS THAT MAY BE TAKEN TO SMALL CLAIMS COURT), AS\r
THE EXCLUSIVE FORM OF DISPUTE RESOLUTION EXCEPT AS PROVIDED FOR BELOW, FOR\r
ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED BELOW. THE TERM \"DISPUTE\" MEANS ANY\r
DISPUTE, CLAIM OR CONTROVERSY NOW OR IN THE FUTURE BETWEEN YOU AND UBIQUITI\r
WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, STATUTE, REGULATION, ORDINANCE, TORT (INCLUDING,\r
BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FRAUD, MISREPRESENTATION, FRAUDULENT INDUCEMENT, OR\r
NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, AND INCLUDING THE\r

PURCHASED THIS MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION WOULD APPLY UNLESS YOU CHOOSE\r
TO OPT- OUT AS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THE TERM \"PRODUCT\" INCLUDES THE PHYSICAL\r
PRODUCT PURCHASED AND ANY SOFTWARE NECESSARY TO OPERATE THAT PRODUCT.\r
\"Dispute\" is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be\r
enforced. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration\r
uses a neutral, third-person arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows\r
for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited\r
review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a\r
court can award. Please visit http://www.iccwbo.org for more information.\r

ii) How to Opt Out of Mandatory Arbitration. Notwithstanding the above, you\r
or Ubiquiti may choose to file a lawsuit in court rather than resolving your\r
Dispute by arbitration. You may opt-out of mandatory arbitration if (a) the\r
Dispute qualifies for small claims court (there are monetary limitations for\r
small claims court), or (b) YOU OPT OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES\r
WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU ACCEPT THESE TERMS (the \"Opt-Out\r
Deadline\"). In order to opt out of mandatory arbitration, you need to (I)\r
mail written notification to Ubiquiti Networks, Inc., Legal Department, 685\r
Third Avenue, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10017; or (II) email written\r
notification to legal@ubnt.com. In either case, your written notification\r
must include: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a copy of your receipt or\r
other proof of purchase, showing the date of purchase, and (4) a clear\r
statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Ubiquiti through\r
arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this provision will have no adverse\r
effect on your relationship with Ubiquiti. Any opt-out request received\r
after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your\r
Dispute in arbitration or, if the dispute qualifies, in small claims court.\r
\r
iii) Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution: For all disputes, whether pursued in\r
court or in mandatory arbitration, you must first give Ubiquiti written\r
notification and forty-five (45) days to resolve the Dispute. The written\r
notification shall include the information listed above in the preceding\r
paragraph (ii)(b) items (1) -(3) plus (4) a written description of your\r

Dispute and (5) a written description of the relief you seek. It is to be\r
sent to the address listed at (ii)(b)(I) in the above paragraph. If Ubiquiti\r
does not resolve the dispute within 45 days, you may pursue your dispute in\r
arbitration. You may pursue your dispute in a court only under the\r
circumstances described above in the Opt Out provision.\r
\r
iv) Arbitration Process.\r
(1) Commencing Arbitration. A party who intends to seek arbitration must\r
first send to the other, by a reputable courier with a tracking mechanism, a\r
written notice of intent to arbitrate (a \"Notice\"), or, in the absence of a\r
mailing address provided by you to Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti can send to you\r
by any other method available to Ubiquiti for sending such notice, including\r
via e-mail. The Notice to Ubiquiti should be addressed to 685 Third Avenue,\r
27th Floor, New York, New York 10017, Attn: Chief Legal Officer (the\r
\"Arbitration Notice Address\"). The Notice shall include the information\r
listed above in paragraph (II)(b) items (1) -(3) plus (4) a written\r
description of your Dispute and (5) a written description of the relief you\r
seek (the \"Demand\"). THE ARBITRATION WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE\r
INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR DISPUTE RESOLUTION (\"ICDR\") IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\r
INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION RULES (THE \"Rules\"), AS MODIFIED HEREIN. The Rules\r
are available at https://www.icdr.org. Except as otherwise set forth herein,\r
if you are required to pay a filing fee to commence arbitration against\r
Ubiquiti, then Ubiquiti will, within ten (10) business days of receipt of\r

payment of the filing fee that exceeds the amount of any fees you would be\r
required to pay if the Demand were filed in federal court in the Southern\r
District of New York upon Ubiquiti?s receipt of Notice at the Arbitration\r
Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration along with a receipt\r
evidencing payment of the filing fee.\r
\r
(2) Arbitration Proceeding. The arbitration will be conducted in English and\r
a translator may be utilized as the expense of the party requiring the\r
translation services. A single independent and impartial arbitrator with his\r
or her primary place of business in New York, New York will be appointed\r
pursuant to the Rules. You and Ubiquiti agree to the following rules, which\r
are intended to streamline the dispute resolution process and reduce the\r
costs and burdens on the parties: (a) subject to the Rules, the arbitration\r
shall be conducted online via videoconference, telephonically and/or be\r
solely based on written submissions- rather than requiring the personal\r
appearance of the parties- with the specific manner to be mutually agreed\r
upon in writing by the parties and (b) any judgment on the award rendered by\r
the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\r
\r
(3) No Class Actions. YOU AND UBIQUITI AGREE THAT YOU AND UBIQUITI MAY BRING\r
CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS\r
A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE\r

OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING, AND THAT IF THIS\r
SPECIFIC PROVISO IS FOUND TO BE UNENFORCEABLE, THEN THE ENTIRETY OF THIS\r
MANDATORY ARBITRATION SECTION WILL BE NULL AND VOID. IF YOU CHOOSE TO PURSUE\r
YOUR DISPUTE IN COURT BY OPTING OUT OF THIS PROVISION, AS SPECIFIED ABOVE,\r
THIS CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL NOT APPLY TO YOU. NEITHER YOU, NOR ANY OTHER\r
USER OF THE PRODUCT OR SERVICES CAN BE A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS MEMBER,\r
OR OTHERWISE PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE\r

\r
(4) Decision of the Arbitrator. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the\r
arbitrator will issue his or her decision within one-hundred and twenty\r
(120) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may\r
extend this time limit for an additional thirty (30) days in the interests\r
of justice upon written notice by the arbitrator to you and Ubiquiti at\r
least twenty-one (21) days prior to the last date to issue his or her\r
decision. Failure to adhere to this time limit shall not constitute a basis\r
for challenging the arbitration award. All arbitration proceedings will be\r
closed to the public and confidential, and all records relating thereto will\r
be permanently sealed, except as necessary to obtain court confirmation of\r
the arbitration award. The award of the arbitrator will be in writing and\r
will include a statement setting forth the reasons for the disposition of\r

interpretation, enforcement, and proceedings pursuant to the Mandatory\r
Arbitration clause in this Agreement.\r

(5) Arbitration Award. The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any\r
relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have\r
the power to award relief to, against, or for the benefit of any person who\r
is not a party to the proceeding. Such award will be final and binding on\r
the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal\r
Arbitration Act, and may be entered in any court having competent\r
jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.\r
\r
v) Equitable Relief.\r
(1) You acknowledge that, in the event Ubiquiti or a third party breaches\r
this Agreement, the damage or harm, if any, caused to you will not entitle\r
you to seek injunctive or other equitable relief against Ubiquiti, and your\r
only remedy will be for monetary damages, subject to the limitations of\r
liability set forth in this Agreement.\r

vi) Claims. You and Ubiquiti agree that, notwithstanding any other rights\r
the party may have under law or equity, any cause of action arising out of\r
or related to this Agreement, the Software or any Ubiquiti device, excluding\r
a claim for indemnification, must commence within one (1) year after the\r
cause of action accrues. Otherwise, such cause of action is permanently\r
barred.\r
\r
vii) Punitive Damages. You and Ubiquiti agree that the arbitrator is not\r
authorized to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing\r
party?s actual damages, subject to the limitations of liability set forth in\r
this Agreement.\r
\r
viii) Jury Waiver. You understand and agree that by failing to opt out to\r
this provision you and Ubiquiti are each waiving the right to a jury trial\r
or a trial before a judge in public court. In the absence of this provision,\r
you and Ubiquiti might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring\r
Disputes in court, before a judge or jury and/or to participate or be\r
represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions).\r
Except as otherwise provided herein, those rights are waived.\r

Section 16(c) is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this\r
Section 16(c) will be null and void and, in such Section 16(a) and (b) will\r
